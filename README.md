quizproject
===========

This project is for building a framework geared towards simple lightweight HTML5/JavaScript quizzes that display results on a grid as a single-page app.

Usage
===========

The framework accepts questions in two separate arbitrary categories with one being tracked to display on the X-axis of the grid and the other being tracked to display on the Y-axis of the grid. Each question accepts an 'agree,' 'disagree,' or 'no answer' value. The final results are displayed on a grid as well as numerical percentage results in each category.

Markup
===========

The markup block for each question is as follows:

``` html
HTML CODE BLOCK WILL GO HERE
```

You can have as many questions in each category as you like.
